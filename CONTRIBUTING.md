## How You Can Contribute

There are a few things we'll always want to improve in Good First Issue... and are great ways to contribute!

### Adding New Projects

See [Adding New Projects](https://github.com/bnb/good-first-issue#adding-new-projects) in the README.md if you would like to add a new project.

### Solidifying the Module

Good First Issue can be utilized as a module. While its initial intent was for use as a CLI, it has the added functionality of serving as a module to highlight good first issues for a particular project. If you're interested in contributing to refining the interface and ensuring a positive experience for end-users, your assistance would be greatly appreciated. ðŸ˜Š
### Enhancing Tests

We use [Jest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest) for tests, and [Standard](https://www.npmjs.com/package/standard) for linting. If you would like to help Good First Issue by enhancing our test suite or improving linting, we more than welcome your contributions.

### Improving Documentation

We keep our documentation in [README.md](./README.md). If there's anything in there that doesn't currently reflect the state of the module or CLI, or anything that's unclear, improvements are *always* welcome.
